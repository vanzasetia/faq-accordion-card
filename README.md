## Overview

### Introduction

Welcome to the `README.md` of this repo! In this file I'm going to tell you everything, start from what tool I use, how to contribute, and much more.

This my first JavaScript challenge from Frontend Mentor after learning JavaScript for about one month.

That's it for the introduction and **happy reading!**

### The Challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

Additional challenge for accessibility:

- User should be able to navigate this website using keyboard
- User should be able to understand the page content when using screen reader

### Useful Resources

[Accordion Example | WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/accordion/accordion.html) - I didn't know how to create an accessible accordion, but this example helps me out! It tells me the exact markup and the explanation.

## Acknowledgements

The motivation to create a great `README.md` is coming from [awesome-readme repository](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme/blob/master/readme.md) where it lists a lot of great projects with awesome `README.md`. That also my inspiration when I want to improve my `README.md`.
